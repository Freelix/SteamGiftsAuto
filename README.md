SteamGiftsAuto
===================

This is a google chrome extension for selecting games automatically on [SteamGifts](http://www.steamgifts.com/). Just click on the icon and add steam games to have a chance to win them.

## What you can do

- Handle a list of games with a simple interface
- One click button will enter giveaways based on your list


## Technologies Used

 - Chrome Extension
 - [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/IndexedDB), a database embed in the browser

## Newer Version

A newer version is available on this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Freelix/0eb643a753902026982a). Instead of being a chrome extension, it's a script that you can setup to run each few hours to enter giveaways. All you have to do is start this script and check every weeks on the website to know if you won something.
